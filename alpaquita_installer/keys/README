This location should contain APK public keys used to install the distro-keys
package. All other APK packages will be installed using the keys from distro-keys.

The keys must be organized in 2 subdirectories:
 * glibc - for glibc Alpaquita
 * musl - for musl Alpaquita

 The layout of keys in each subdirectory is the same as in /etc/apk/keys.
